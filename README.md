    - - **Integration with APIs**: Utilize APIs like OpenAI for content generation and Canva for design to enhance agent capabilities.
     
      - ## Future Development
      - - **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale to support multiple channels and diverse content types.
        - - **Collaboration**: Implement frameworks like CrewAI for effective orchestration and collaboration among agents.
